Installation
------------

This plugin requires Hey0's server modification.

  1. Create a "plugins" folder inside your "bin" folder.

  2. Copy CraftBook.jar into "plugins".

  3. Add "CraftBook" to the "plugins" line of your server.properties file.
     If it's not already there, add the line. The line should look like this:
  
         plugins=CraftBook
     
     If you have multiple plugins, separate plugin names with commas.

  4. Copy "craftbook-books.txt", "custom-ics.txt", and "cauldron-recipes.txt"
     into the your "bin" folder (where the server files reside).
