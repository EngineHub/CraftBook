Branch Structure
----------------

Currently the 'master' branch contains CraftBook 4, the next version of CraftBook. Currently this version only supports Sponge.

For the prior version of CraftBook for Bukkit and Spigot, the '3.x' branch is what you want.

Starting from CraftBook 4, there are 'version' branches that contain the last supported version for a branch. This is used for backporting reasons. The format is as follows, `version/1.x`.
