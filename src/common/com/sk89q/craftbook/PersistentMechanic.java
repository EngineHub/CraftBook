/**
 * PersistentMechanic exist to keep internal state in situations where the
 * instantiation of the Mechanic may be relatively expensive. However, they are
 * in many cases not appropriate tools since limitations in the core of Bukkit
 * mean that it is not always possible to catch all events that a
 * PersistentMechanic may need in order to perform the caching of mechanism
 * state this class was designed to facilitate with verifiable correctness.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Mechanic at minimum has one or more BlockVector which it wishes to receive
 * events from -- these are called "triggers". These BlockVector are also
 * registered with a MechanicManager when the Mechanic is loaded into that
 * MechanicManager.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Mechanic may also have a set of BlockVector which it wishes to receive
 * events from because they may change the state of the mechanism, but they
 * aren't explicitly triggers -- these are called "defining". An example of
 * defining blocks are the vertical column of blocks in an elevator mechanism,
 * since the operation of the elevator depends on where there is open space in
 * blocks that are clearly not trigger blocks. Defining blocks are also
 * registered with a MechanicManager, but are distinct from trigger blocks in
 * that a single BlockVector may be considered defining to multiple mechanisms.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Mechanic may alter or examine the contents of BlockVector other than those
 * that are explicitly trigger or definer BlockVector. These are the BlockVector
 * that the Mechanic "enhances", but there is no formal interface in which these
 * must be enumerated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The requirement of providing correct service even when this Mechanic instance
 * is discarded and another reconstructed over the same blocks of the world laid
 * out for all Mechanic still applies to PersistentMechanic!
