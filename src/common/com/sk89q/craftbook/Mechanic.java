 * Mechanic instances are subject to lazy instantiation and must be able to
 * derive all of their internal state from the blocks in the world at any time.
 * Mechanic instances should be able to be discarded at essentially any time and
 * without warning, and yet be able to provide correct service whenever a new
 * Mechanic instance is created over the same BlockVector unless the contents of
 * the BlockVector have been otherwise interfered with in the intervening time
 * -- this is so that Mechanic instances can be discarded when their containing
 * chunks are unloaded, as well as for general insurance against server crashes.
