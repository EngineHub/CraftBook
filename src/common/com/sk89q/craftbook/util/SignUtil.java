/**
 * <p>
 * Convenience methods for dealing with some sign block data.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you intend to care about the eight further directions (as opposed to the
 * four cardinal directions and the four ordinal directions), this isn't for you
 * -- since BlockFace has no such directions, those will be rounded to the
 * nearest ordinal direction. (If the term "further direction" confuses you,
 * see https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cardinal_directions).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is direly close to being a replicate of things you can access via
 * org.bukkit.material.Sign (which extends MaterialData). However, that thing:
 * <ul>
 * <li>doesn't provide the relative direction methods.
 * <li>rounds the further divisions to cardinal/ordinal differently (and wrong,
 * in my book).
 * <li>has the same class name for that MaterialData thing as the BlockState,
 * which is annoying as hell import-wise.
 * <li>requires allocating an object and copying two bytes in a fashion that I
 * consider kinda unnecessary.
 * </ul>
 * Ideally, I think I'd like to see if I can get something like these methods
 * pushed to bukkit.
 * </p>
