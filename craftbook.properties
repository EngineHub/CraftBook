## CraftBook configuration
##

# Enabling the setting below causes CraftBook to check permissions to see
# whether a player can *use* a feature (not create). If you enable it,
# you must give users permissions for the following virtual commands
# for the respective features that you want to allow:
#   /appledrops - Apples to be dropped from trees
#   /bookshelfdrops - Bookshelves drop when mined
#   /readbooks - Book reading feature
#   /gate - Toggle gates
#   /lightswitch - Toggle light switches
#   /elevator - Toggle elevators
#   /togglearea - Toggle areas
#   /bridge - Toggle bridges
#   /cauldron - Cauldron usage
check-permissions=false

# A potentially more useful way to restrict features is to prevent
# people from setting up certain features such as bridges. Enabling the
# setting below will allow you to do that. You will have to give
# permissions to the virtual commands that are applicable:
#   /makegate
#   /makelightswitch
#   /makeelevator
#   /maketogglearea
#   /makebridge
#   /makeic
#   /makedoor
# Note that in the case of "restricted ICs" like the mob spawner, /makeic
# is not enough. The player must either have /allic or /mc####.
