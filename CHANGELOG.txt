dev:
[Toggleable areas]
- Toggleable areas have been overhauled. Now they are saved per-user and
    no other user can toggle another user's areas (without permission).
    Existing area files will have to be moved to
    world/craftbook/copyareas/global
    and have ".cbcopy" be appended to their filenames. These areas will
    be in the global namespace.
- New [Area] sign replaces [Toggle] sign. This new sign has namespace
    support (3rd line). Leave blank to set it as the namespace for your
    own player or use "@" for the global namespace (if you have permission).
    The fourth line indicates the other state to switch to when the
    area is turned off (best used with redstone) -- use "-" to indicate
    the action of doing nothing and leave blank to clear (default behavior).
- Toggle area signs can now be triggered with redstone.
- Fixed toggle areas dropping items.
- Fixed packet spam caused by toggling areas.
[Redstone]
- Added 2-tick propagation delay to ICs and redstone-powered mechanisms.
    Removes old recursion limit method of infinite loop prevention.
- Added redstone netherstone (disabled by default). This allows you to
    toggle fire with redstone.
- All redstone devices can now take redstone current input on a level
    above the actual device, allowing you to wire pumpkins from
    above, for example (note: you still should not put wires on top of
    pumpkins as they will be removed by Minecraft).
[ICs]
- New 3I3O family with 3 inputs and 3 outputs.
- Added MC3040 (multiplexer), MC4000 (full adder), MC4010 (half adder),
    MC4100 (full subtractor), MC4110 (half subtractor),
    MC3032 (JK negative edge-triggered flip flop), MC3101 (down counter),
    MC4200 (dispatcher), MC1202 (chest dispenser),
    MC0020 (self-triggering random bit),
    MC0111 (self-triggering reciever), MC0230 (self-triggering day check),
    MC1240 (arrow shooter), MC1241 (arrow barrage), and
    MC0420 (self-triggering clock).
- New MC3033 (RS NAND latch) replaces defunct MC3031.
- MC1200 (mob spawner) now supports riders. Specify the rider on the
    fourth line.
- Changed MC1110 to output the input.
- Allowed the set block ICs to displace a block ("force" must be the
    fourth line). 
- Blocked the dispensing/creation of pre-Alpha cloth blocks with ICs.
- Added support for self-triggering ICs. No more clocks on recievers!
- Added MC5001, a variant of MC5000 using the 3 input, 3 output layout.
- Added support for custom ICs using existing PLC languages.
- Added new redstone-plcs-require-permission configuration.
- Added /listics command.
- Added Perlstone32 PLC language.
- Fixed issue with the 32nd slot of Perlstone's tables.
- Fixed chest dispenser IC being able to dispense -1 of an item.
- Added Perlstone32 PLC language.
[Block bags]
- Overhauled block bag system for bridges, gates, etc. Now multiple
    block bags can be used simultaneously.
- New administrator-only sign-based infinite block bags.
- Fixed issue with item duplication with the nearby-chests block bag
    (this may be obsolete with Minecraft beta).
- The nearby-chests block bag should no longer break between Minecraft
    updates, pending update of hMod.
- Removed the requirement of the nearby chest block bag needing one item in
    the chest to begin with.
[Minecarts]
- Added minecart sort control block. This allows you to switch track 
    direction based on criteria (such as whether the cart is empty, if
    the passenger is of a certain hMod group, if the passenger is holding
    a certain item, etc.). It is currently not possible to filter by
    mob type inside the minecart.
- Minecart station blocks now continually push when activated. To pulse
    (old behavior), put "Pulse" on the third or fourth line.
- The minecart dispenser can now dispense onto anything.
- Minecart dispensers will now collect the contents of storage minecarts
    and store them.
- Minecart dispensers can now dispense other types of minecarts by
    specifying "Storage" or "Powered" on the 3rd line. If a type is
    specified, minecarts of that type will also be stored (instead of
    breaking apart minecarts into their respective craftable pieces).
- Minecart dispensers will now push dispensed minecarts if Push is on the
    fourth line of the sign.
- The minecart trigger block has been dropped.
- A new deposit minecart block can deposit a storage minecart's contents
    into adjacent chests or deposit the contents of chests into a storage
    minecart automatically.
- Redstone currents can now be put on the same level as the tracks
    for minecart control blocks.
- Added an empty minecart delay that will remove empty minecarts after
    left unoccupied by players for a certain amount of time.
- Added an option to destroy minecarts on exit of them.
- Fixed the minecart dispenser not collecting carts that were on a slope.
- Fixed issue where minecarts significantly slowed down on pressure plates.
- Fixed minecart ejector blocks so they should now more accurately
    eject players now so that they won't fall through.
- Fixed issue with station blocks not working well if the sign was only
    one block underneath the station block.
- Fixed an issue where changing the station block type to something other
    than obsidian did not work correctly.
[Cauldrons]
- Added per-group permissions for cauldrons.
- Added reload-cauldron console command. 
- If the cauldron recipes file is missing, the current working directory
    will now be printed.
- Fixed potential issue with the cauldron dropping items.
[Mechanisms]
- Bridges can now cut through snow.
- New doors are a vertical form of bridges. Use [Door Up] and [Door Down]
    and [Door End]. They work like bridge signs, although you have to
    specify a direction that the door is in (unlike bridges).
- New hidden redstone switches. Put a sign with [X] as the second line next
    to a block (either next to it, on top, or below) and then put switches
    right next to the sign at right angles. While holding no item, right
    click the block to toggle the switch(es).
[Misc]
- New /reload CraftBook command reloads CraftBook's configuration. /reload *
    can be used to reload other plugins (utilizing the same system)
    in addition to hMod as well.
- Version detection should now be more accurate, working even if you reload
    the plugin.
- Various messages were added during feature setup (such as bridge setup)
    in order to guide players. This may be too noisy so it may be removed
    or at least toned down in the future.
- Fixed issue where the elevator could drop players into a deadly fall
    or put players inside blocks. Now the player is simply not teleported
    and is informed instead.

1.4:
- Added MC5000, a programmable logic chip utilizing the PerlStone
    language. Contributed by Lymia.
- Gates can now displace lava in addition to water.
- Minecarts can now be controlled by hitting the cart from within it.
- Added a minecart message control block that will print a message to a
    player's chat when s/he passes over the block in a minecart.
- Added minecart ejection control block to eject the player.
- Added reverse and directed reverse minecart control blocks.
- New minecart dispensers that will pick up minecarts that hit it (a chest)
    and will dispense carts when given a redstone current.
- Added configuration options to change the minecart control block types.
- Replaced the minecart coast factor with a function to hinder the
    gradual slow down of unoccupied minecarts.
- New experimental minecart trigger block that toggles switches on
    the side of the block (doesn't work too swell yet).
- Pressure plates should now no longer bring minecarts to a dead stop.
- Station signs can now be only one block below the station block.
- Minecart station blocks now give a slightly stronger boost.
- MC1200 now spawns mobs in the first free block above the block behind
    the IC sign.
- MC1201 now spawn mobs above the block behind the IC sign.
- Added MC1025 that places a block two blocks above the block
    behind the IC sign.
- Added MC1026 that places a block two blocks below the block
    behind the IC sign.

1.3.1:
- Fixed bug with MC1201.

1.3:
- Added MC3020 (2-input XOR gate), MC3002 (3-input AND),
    MC3003 (3-input NAND), MC3021 (2-input XNOR), MC3030 (RS NOR latch),
    MC3031 (RS NAND latch), MC3034 (D rising edge-triggered flip flop),
    MC3035 (D level-triggered flip flop), MC3231 (time control),
    MC1201 (dispenser).
- Minecart booster and station blocks added. They were accidentally added
    by 1.2.1 got out, so many of you have already been running it. I didn't
    mean to have them get into the main CraftBook branch yet -- but they
    have. Gold blocks underneath a track give a 2x boost, gold ore gives
    25% boost, slow sand gives a 50% slow down, and gravel gives a
    20% slow down. Station blocks are made of obsidian -- wire them
    and have a low input to stop all carts that pass over. Put a sign
    two blocks below facing the direction that you want to go and
    give a high input to have the cart pushed in the sign's direction
    (no diagonals!).
- Improved redstone triggering so that redstone devices to the right/left
    and above of an input block but have nothing under them will not prevent
    trigerring.
- Fixed for the MC update.

1.2.1:
- Added a recursion limit to the redstone processing.
- Increased the height that mobs spawned at with MC1200 by one block up.

1.2:
- Water and lava can now be used reliably as ingredients. Specify
    moving water/lava, not the stationary water/lava.
- Rewrote redstone triggering for bridges and gates. They will now not
    trigger by redstone as easily -- they now act more like doors and
    other redstone components in that the wire must run up to the sign
    and not just merely pass by it. Note that you can also run wires
    directly underneath the sign and that will work.
- Added redstone integrated circuits. They compact complicated and
    otherwise impossible components into very small functional blocks.
- Pumpkin redstone input triggering has been expanded so that you can lead
    wires up to it instead of only under it. Note that you should not
    put redstone components above pumpkins as pumpkins tend to 'eat' the
    redstone items.
- CraftBook now has conditional hook registration so that it will not
    completely fail if a feature of hMod is not available for
    whatever reason.
- New ammeter (coal) can be right clicked on redstone components to get
    their current level.
- Bridges can now cut through water, allowing you to make flat flood gates
    in addition to vertical flood gates (with the gate feature). This also
    applies to lava so that you can make lava flood gates.
- Fixed the /elevator permission not working, added /togglearea
    and /bridge as permissions.
- Added create permissions that allow you to restrict the *creation* of
    features (such as bridges and gates). check-create-permissions must
    be enabled (default not).
- Bookshelf and apple drops should now occur at the place of the block
    and not at the player's feet.
- Updated for the new server update.
- Caught IOException thrown by the new properties class in hMod.

1.1:
- Pumpkins can be toggled off and on (between their lit and unlit states) by
    putting redstone under the pumpkin.
- Bridges now support redstone. Wire to the sign.
- Gates now support redstone. Just wire the sign itself.
- Bridge signs can now be *below* the bridge and out of view.
- Bridges can now be made out of other blocks (although the entire bridge
    has to be of one type). Change the list of allowable blocks in
    CraftBook's properties file.
- The maximum length of bridges can now be configured.
- [I] can be used instead of [|] for light switches.
- You can now do 'grass1:dirt*3,sapling:grass*3' for cauldron
    configuration (multipliers and item names). Comments can also now
    start with the sharp (#) sign.

0.4:
- Added the bridge.
- Added toggle-able areas.
- Added chest support to prevent item farming.
- Apple drop chance can be a decimal number. Now use -1 to disable entirely.
- Added support for setting permissions for each function so only some
    groups can use some functions.
- Fixed sign posts not working for some functions.
- Added the ability to change the "you pick out a book..." message for the
    book reading feature.

0.3:
- b123 (Halloween update) compatible.

0.2:
- Added the elevator.
- Added the cauldron.
- Added apple drops.
- Added bookshelf drops.
- Made book reading code able to handle the first and last lines of a file.
- Made the gate toggle range slightly larger so you can toggle larger gates
    and you don't have to have the sign up very high.

0.1:
- Initial release.
